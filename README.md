# Note
I forked this presentation from [here][orig] and thinned it out a bit (removed outdated information and kept the images). Special thanks to [John Lewis][jl] for originally putting these together.

Intro to Docker
===============

This is an Intro to Docker slide deck built using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

The contents of the the slides have been stol..., umm, -liberally borrowed- 
from [Docker Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/dotCloud) materials.

Thanks to everyone at Docker, Inc for all the great work they are doing!

I've been promoting Docker in my own circles, and really wanted a standard
HTML5-based presentation to use when doing so. I hope others find this
helpful, and I'm more than happy for the Docker community to find some
use in this.
